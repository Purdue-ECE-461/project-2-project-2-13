In our system, we first require the user to install all dependencies for our program. This can be done through the “./run install” command in a terminal and will ready the program for execution. All the user needs at this point is a list of GitHub or npmjs URLs in a file and they can call “./run filename.txt” to begin execution. They also need to set two environment variables: GITHUB_TOKEN and LOG_FILE. Our system then takes each URL and runs it through our grading system that was described in Milestone 1. Data from the GitHub repository provided is retrieved from the GitHub API and is then used to perform grading calculations. As URLs are parsed, the terminal program will output the total score along with the sub scores (Ramp-up, correctness, bus factor, responsiveness, and license). Furthermore, a file is produced containing all of the URLs with their net score in order of decreasing trustworthiness (high net score to low net score). Once all URLs in the provided file are graded, the system will exit and terminate.
